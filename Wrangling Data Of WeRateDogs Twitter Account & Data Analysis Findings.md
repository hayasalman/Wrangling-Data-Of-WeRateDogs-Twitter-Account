## Overview 

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. And the dataset that we will be wrangling is the tweet archive of Twitter user **(@dog_rates)**. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media attention both for its popularity.

## Approaches & Methodologies

  - **Gathering data** : the first step of data wrangling is to collect data from different sources.
 
  - **Assessing data** : : assessing the data both visually & programmatically to discover any quality\tidiness issues. The four main data quality 
      dimensions are: Accuracy, Validity, Completeness Consistency , while the structural issues related to tidiness issues.
    
  - **Cleaning data** : after the data assessment we will start to clean it from the quality\tidiness issues that we found before.
 
  - **Storing data** : we need to store the cleaned dataset into a new csv file called twitter archive master before we analyze it.
 
  - **Analyzing , and visualizing data** : by performing graphical and non-graphical exploratory data analysis.
 
  - **Communicating the findings** : through communicates all the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data.
